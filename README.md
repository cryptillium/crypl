# crypl
This is a Javascript library for working with API's for different cryptocurrency exchanges. The purpose of this library is to offer an easy way to communicate with different exchanges with a standardised way of calling various functions and having a standard output rather than having different function names for different exchanges for the same thing and also producing different responses.

This library was built on ideas and inspirations of other solutions offered in the market with improvements in areas that are lacking or unavailable.
